# NLP-practice
Repository for my Natural Language Processing (NLP) practice.<br>

## Grammatical Framework (GF)<br>
This repository contains files from both the Grammatical Framework [tutorial](https://www.grammaticalframework.org/doc/tutorial/gf-tutorial.html) and files created myself.<br>
1. Download and Install Grammatical Framework [here](https://www.grammaticalframework.org/download/index-3.11.html).<br>
2. Nativate to /GF folder, then navigate to desired subfolder within the /GF folder.<br>
3. Run GF with `$ gf` command. View possible commands using the `> help` command within GF. Alternatively, run a GF script `.gfs` file from Linux command line with `$ gf --run <[filename].gfs`.<br>
